	    <p>I think I finally got there with these paintings. They are very different from my previous work that has been more socially or politicfally engaged and shaped by the tensions I brought with me from my &quot;old country&quot;. These paintings are bringing me other satisfactions.</p>
	    <p>I feel I can play more with shapes and geometry or colors. I would say there is no limit; like breaking the shapes of already framed pictures and giving the new dimensions to the painting or to the space. I found this very enjoyable and exciting.</p>
	    <p>I never know where is it going to get me, and that makes me happy.</p>
