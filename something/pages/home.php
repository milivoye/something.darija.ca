    	<p>I was born and raised in Bosnia and Herzegovina. I have moved to Belgrade in the middle of the awful and bloody war and I get my degree there at University of Fine Arts. That gave me an opportunity to express my disgust with authorities, mentality and a tradition of wrong choices, and to criticize the society through my works and try to set the focus on consequences of our misdoings. I also had a chance to work as an elementary school art teacher.</p>
    	<p>In 2010 I left for Canada with my family to re-start our lives. As I discovered my private inner peace here in Calgary and achieved a new balance, my artistic expression shifted toward abstraction and my interests are focused on less bitter themes.</p>
