        <!--p>&ldquo;Reflection&rdquo; is a piece based on Albanian translation of &ldquo;Kosovo polje&rdquo;, a poem of famous Serbian poet M. Bećković. The poem is an anti-albanian pamphlet from the very beginning of the wars of the Yugoslav succession, and its purpose was to mark the enemy for the emerging conflict and to prevent and deny the possibility for a dialog and mutual understanding. It&rsquo;s an evergreen of Serbian militant nationalism filled with pathetical resentment, identity mythos and victim mentality. The footage I used for this video was taken at the state organized &ldquo;Glorious National Rally&rdquo; from 2008 that ended with burning Belgrade embassies and looting. The idea of this piece is to symbolically re-establish the communication, and to point out that even conflicting ideas and narratives should pre presented to the other party.</p-->
        <p>&ldquo;Reflection&rdquo; is an audio-visual work based on the Albanian translation of the poem &ldquo;Kosovo Polje&rdquo; by the famous Serbian poet M. Beckovic. Emotionally charged this poem sings about identity, about its exclusivity and vulnerability. It sings about a mythical land in one color, looking at it with the one eye, playing a tune in a single string...
            I am not aware that the poem &ldquo;Kosovo Polje&rdquo; was previously published in Albanian, so I'm offering this translation as a contribution to establishing communication; the invitation to convey thoughts and ideas to the other party, however conflicting in intention and incongruous in expression they might be.</p>
